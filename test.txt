 Note:
  - The architect's scheduling of work with
  the
  orchestrator should be a skill.
  - The architect should have a skill to
  facilitate ready adjustment of an executing
  workflow and signal the orchestrator to
  adjust.
  - The orchestrator should be able to
  readily
  receive and adjust to updated or even
  cancelled workflows.
  - The orchestrator's ability to request
  changes to the architect's plan should be a
  skill with the new workflow/adjusted
  workflow
  as the output.
  - The librarian should have a skill to scan
  remote github repositories as well,
  including
  private ones.
  - The librarian should have skills or
  dynamcially configurable skills to
  identify the languages and thus linting
  tools, LSPs, formatters, and other tooling
  available or appropriate.
  - The engineer should have skills or
  dynamcially configurable skills for calling
  tools like
  ast-grep, glob, grep, running bash
  commands,
  running lsps/formatters/linting tools
  identified by the librarian and approved by
  the user via architect, running cat on
  files,
  running sed, running awk, running ping, and
  other common bash commands.
  - The engineer should also should also have
  the abiliy to
  create virtual environments, install
  packages
  already existent in the project or approved
  by
  the user, etc.
  - The inspector should also have skills or
  dynamcially configurable skills to run tools
  like
  LSPs, formatters, linters, type-checkers,
  and other tools identified by the
  librarian.
  - The inspector should also have the abiliy
  to
  create virtual environments, install
  packages
  already existent in the project or approved
  by
  the user, etc.
  - The tester should have a dynamically
  configurable skills to run tools that call
  test frameworks or libraries specified by
  the
  user or identified as appropriate by the
  librarian for the codebase.
  - The tester should also have the abiliy to
  create virtual environments, install
  packages
  already existent in the project or approved
  by the user, etc.
  - The tester should have skills that can
  call cat, grep, and
  non-write bash skills that can call
  appropriate tools.

  I also STILL do not see a dedicate section in
  our TODO.md on the changes needed to the
  guide and archivalist clients to make them
  compatible with our architecture.
